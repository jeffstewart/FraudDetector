### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend installing [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Code is contained in the iPython Notebook fraud.ipynb
The code used in this project has been modified from the Supervised Learning Project (Finding Donors)

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `fraud/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook fraud.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook fraud.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
